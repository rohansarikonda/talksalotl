# Talksalotl

This Talksalotl app was made by Rohan Sarikonda, Shaina Premraj, Vasudevan Lakshmanan, and Sasha Nandyala at the Massachusetts Academy of Math & Science @ WPI. This is our project for Apps for Good.

The Talksalotl app is meant to help people that want to learn English with pronunciation and readinga comprehension. While there are apps on the market that assist with language acquisition, they don't focus as heavily on pronunciation or reading comprehension as Talksalotl does.

Note: there is a keys.dart file in the file structure that is untracked. This is where our app and secret keys for the SpeechSuper API are held.
